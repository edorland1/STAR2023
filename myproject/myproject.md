##### Discription:

This summer, I have the privilege of working in Dr. Swetnam's lab, delving into the fascinating intersection of Artificial Inteligence (AI) and scientific research. Dr. Swetnam, a Research Associate Professor of Geoinformatics and Joint faculty member in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, is actively involved in the CyVerse initiative, which promotes open science. Among his various projects, he is currently exploring the applications of AI in scientific fields. My specific focus this summer revolves around the utilization of AI tools such as Chat GPT and Google Bard to examine their impact on data analysis in the context of epidemic-related data (e.g., Covid-19, Cholera). The goal is to develop a reusable Python code that can effectively generate heat maps, which visually show areas of concentration so that we can track hotspots of illness. By addressing the transformative influence of AI on scientific endeavors, we aim to foster a more accessible and collaborative scientific community. In essence, this research journey embraces the promising prospects of AI, forging new paths in scientific inquiry while cultivating a more inclusive approach to knowledge discovery.

##### Introduction


  As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to exert a growing influence on our society and scientific 
endeavors, it becomes imperative that we adapt to its presence. The way we interact with data must 
evolve, and it is crucial to harness the potential of these new tools effectively. This project focuses on 
utilizing AI tools to analyze epidemic-related data, specifically data on COVID-19 and Cholera, and 
exploring their efficiency in understanding and mitigating these diseases. The research undertaken aims 
to facilitate the widespread integration of AI in the field of data science, accompanied by the 
development of a reusable program. One of the key objectives is to create a Python code capable of 
evaluating specialized data and generating heat maps, which are graphical representations that visually 
highlight areas of concentration or origin for epidemic outbreaks. 
  As AI continues to gain influence, particularly in the field of data science, it offers numerous 
implications. These include accelerating the discovery of relationships within complex data sets and 
automating repetitive tasks, leading to more efficient and accurate data analysis (Brookings, 2023; Our 
World in Data, 2022). Heatmaps are visual representations that utilize colors to display the intensity or 
density of certain data points on a geographical or grid-based layout (NIEHS, n.d.). In the context of 
epidemic-related data analysis, heatmaps can be used to identify areas of concentration or origin for 
diseases. For example, Michael Worobey and his team utilized heatmaps to analyze the genetic diversity 
of COVID-19 and identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as a potential origin (Zimmer et al., 
2020). This approach is reminiscent of the work of John Snow, a pioneer in epidemiology, who famously 
used a heatmap to track the cases of cholera during the 1854 outbreak in London, ultimately identifying 
contaminated water as the source (BBC, n.d.).
  By harnessing the promising prospects of AI, this research journey not only pioneers novel paths 
in scientific inquiry but also fosters a more inclusive approach to knowledge discovery. Through the 
development of this Python code, the project strives to implement the regular use of AI in the data 
science field while creating a reusable program that is open for anyone to use. In essence, it embraces 
the potential of AI, forging new paths in scientific inquiry and data analysis, all while cultivating a more 
inclusive and effective approach to understanding and combating epidemics like COVID-19 and cholera.

Reaserch Question: How can AI tools be effectively utilized to analyze epidemic-related data and improve our understanding and response to diseases like COVID-19 and cholera?
