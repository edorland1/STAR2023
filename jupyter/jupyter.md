# Jupyter Notebooks
## What is it? 
- seamless way to write and iterate python code to perform data analysis 
- Notebooks allows code, figures, diagrams, charts, and explanations to all be stored in one location 
- This allows developer's work to be shared, leading to collaboration and improving reproducibility 
- Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks is free of charge, improving equity in data analysis and software development
- When new notebooks are created prebuilt docker containers are used to put the notebooks at their own path 

## How does it work? 
- The basis for Jupyter Notebooks is IPython, a command line shell for writing code in the terminal
- Juputer Notebooks allows this code to be written and iterated in the browser through the use of the ipykernel 
- lines of code can be run all at once or one at a time
- Jupyter Notebooks supports mulitple languages, most common is python 
- Allows storage of code and inclusion of Markdown files for notes and documentation
- when new notebooks are created prebuilt docker containers are used to place the notebooks on their own paths 

## Structure

### Kernel
- the kernel is specific to the programming language, this project will be in python 
- process that supports the notebook to execute the written code
- Juptyer team maintains the ipykernel, but other user maintained kernels are available for use

### Cell
- the cells are the main contents of the notebooks and are where code is written
- markdown cells can be created to store notes and info on code
- green = code running
- grey = code not running
