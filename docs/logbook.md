Today I worked on finding sources to outline the background information I would need to know in order to complete my project, specifically surrounding the ideas of how Covid-19 is passed and how we can use AI models to predict Covid-19 cases.

Today I took all of my sources and created an annotated bibliography which can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_K_5YrJnE1rd8h-irvmBUi3SujoYheFPt_lQqFRzG5Y/edit?usp=sharing

Today I met with my mentor and we identified my final project surrounding the idea of which method will give us the most accurate Covid-19 predictions. To do this I will be following a few tutorials in order to create a variety of code blocks to create predictions and see what the best way is using either wastewater or google trends data.

Today I had my facilitator meeting and I was able to get some feedback on my rough draft of my Research Proposal. It was really helpful to have some new eyes on my work and it gave me some direction (specifically that I should make sure to lay out everything so people can understand my project)

10/20/23
Today I worked on my Research proposal but I think I need some more information to clear up my methods and what I should write for them.

10/23/23
Today I met with my mentor, we clarified some things, and I have settled on my research question: how can we use machine learning to predict Covid-19 cases using Wastewater data and Google Trends data. We also attemted to work through a tutorial for cleaning some data and begining machine learning, but there were errors on my computer and since I am getting a new one on Wednseday we decided to wait util then to continue. Then I worked on my first reflection assignment for STAR.
