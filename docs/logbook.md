Today I worked on finding sources to outline the background information I would need to know in order to complete my project, specifically surrounding the ideas of how Covid-19 is passed and how we can use AI models to predict Covid-19 cases.

10/15/23
Today I took all of my sources and created an annotated bibliography which can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_K_5YrJnE1rd8h-irvmBUi3SujoYheFPt_lQqFRzG5Y/edit?usp=sharing

Today I met with my mentor and we identified my final project surrounding the idea of which method will give us the most accurate Covid-19 predictions. To do this I will be following a few tutorials in order to create a variety of code blocks to create predictions and see what the best way is using either wastewater or google trends data.

Today I had my facilitator meeting and I was able to get some feedback on my rough draft of my Research Proposal. It was really helpful to have some new eyes on my work and it gave me some direction (specifically that I should make sure to lay out everything so people can understand my project)

10/20/23
Today I worked on my Research proposal but I think I need some more information to clear up my methods and what I should write for them.

10/23/23
Today I met with my mentor, we clarified some things, and I have settled on my research question: how can we use machine learning to predict Covid-19 cases using Wastewater data and Google Trends data. We also attemted to work through a tutorial for cleaning some data and begining machine learning, but there were errors on my computer and since I am getting a new one on Wednseday we decided to wait util then to continue. Then I worked on my first reflection assignment for STAR.

11/1/23 - 12/18/23
During the end of the semester I completed the tutorial, learning more about how to use facebook prophet and what each specific piece of setting up the machine learning model did. Although it was a lot of work (and the logbook got updates less) I am now prepared to apply these ideas within my own project. From here I will clean both of my datasets and ensure they are good to run through my model, and then adjust my model to best predict cases.

Today I met with my mentor, we went over some issues I was having with my datasets and putting them into a format that is usable with the model we are using. We figured out that there is a lot of issues with not having enougn overlap in our different datasets to endure our work is accurate because the wastewater data only goes back to june of 2023. We are reaching out to the people who created the dayaset to see if there is more data available to us, but if not we will be using out model to predict the wastewater data instead, by using the google trends as a comparison and prediction method. From here I am going to be working on finalizing the cleaning of the datasets and then merging them all together.

Today I worked on cleaning my dataset and getting it to a point where I can merge them. I am still running into an issue interpolating the data, but I have been working on getting the google search terms into datasets that I can use. I have gotten about 5 out of 15 terms coded in. From here I just need to get the interpolating to work, add in the last 10 terms and then merge all the data.
