# CyVerse

#### Introduction

[CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/about) serves as a way for life scientists to share their data with others around the world through a common cyberinfrastructure. It is funded by the National Science Foudation's Directorate for Biological Science and is currently led by the University of Arizona. CyVerse's cyberinfrastructure allows scientists to store their data as well as share it with others through cloud computing for further analysis. Acting as a way to complete complex analyses and share large datasets, CyVerse furthers open science and enables a collaborative workspace. 

#### VICE Apps

The [Visual and Interactive Computing Environment(VICE)](https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/) allows scientists to run interactive applications through CyVerse. Through this scientists can open their interactive applications(Jupyter Lab, RStudio, Shiny, WebGL, HTML5, VNC, and XPRA), transfer data into containters, analyze this data, and send their results to the cloud.
