### Python Basics:

- Python Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, enabling modular programming. They encapsulate functionality and promote code reuse.

- Python Classes: Blueprints for creating objects and facilitating object-oriented programming. They define properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects.

- Python Packages: Collections of modules and resources that enhance functionality and simplify application development. They provide pre-built code and tools for specific 

### Data Science:

- Data Cleaning: Process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to ensure data quality.

- Data Analysis: Techniques for exploring, transforming, and deriving insights from data to support decision-making and problem-solving.

- Machine Learning: Algorithms and models that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

### Web Development:

- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the content and layout of web pages.

- CSS: Stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and visual styling of web pages.

- JavaScript: Programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI):

- Machine Learning: Subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI technique that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

- Computer Vision: AI field that deals with enabling computers to see, interpret, and understand visual information.
